üß± Design System Foundations -- Comprehensive Plan
=================================================

1\. **Core Tokenized Foundations**
----------------------------------

These are the atomic materials used to build consistent, scalable interfaces.

* * * * *

### üé® Color

**Importance**: Establishes brand identity, visual hierarchy, and contrast across modes.\
**What to cover**:

-   Palette types: brand, neutral, semantic

-   Light/dark theme structuring

-   Token naming: `color.text.primary`, `color.background.surface`

-   Contrast evaluation with WCAG / APCA

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Maintain minimum contrast ratios (4.5:1 body, 3:1 large text)

-   Use semantic color tokens to provide role-based meaning (e.g., `text.error`)

-   Ensure color is not the only visual signal (add icons, text)

* * * * *

### üî† Typography

**Importance**: Drives readability, hierarchy, and brand personality\
**What to cover**:

-   Typographic scale and hierarchy

-   Font families, fallbacks

-   Line height, letter spacing

-   Token naming: `font.size.md`, `font.family.base`

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Minimum readable size: 16px for body copy

-   Adequate line height (1.4--1.6) for legibility

-   Avoid condensed/stylized fonts for body text

* * * * *

### üìè Spacing & Dimensions

**Importance**: Ensures rhythm, breathing room, and alignment\
**What to cover**:

-   Modular spacing scales (4pt/8pt)

-   Padding and margin tokens

-   Consistency across components

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Maintain sufficient spacing between interactive elements (44px min touch targets)

-   Use white space to improve scan-ability and reduce visual noise

* * * * *

### üìê Layout

**Importance**: Supports structure, alignment, and responsive design\
**What to cover**:

-   Grid systems (8pt baseline, 12-col grid)

-   Breakpoints and fluid layouts

-   Responsive layout tokens and container sizes

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Logical layout order for keyboard and screen readers

-   Avoid content that reflows unpredictably

-   Ensure labels are near associated fields for screen readers

* * * * *

### üñº Icons

**Importance**: Communicate meaning visually at a glance\
**What to cover**:

-   Stroke consistency and style system

-   Sizing and alignment within grids

-   Tokenization: `icon.size.sm`, `icon.color.default`

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Use `aria-label` or text alternatives for standalone icons

-   Avoid relying on icon-only buttons for essential actions

-   Ensure enough contrast against background

* * * * *

### ü™ú Elevation & Shadows

**Importance**: Indicates hierarchy and component layering\
**What to cover**:

-   Shadow ramps and depth system

-   Z-index and surface stacking

-   Elevation tokens: `elevation.01`, `shadow.lg`

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Don't rely solely on shadows to indicate elevation or interactivity

-   Pair with color, border, or motion cues

* * * * *

### üü£ Radius / Shape

**Importance**: Influences the personality of the UI and system identity\
**What to cover**:

-   Border-radius scale: `radius.sm`, `radius.full`

-   Usage patterns (e.g., cards vs buttons)

-   Design token consistency

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Rounded corners may suggest interactivity --- pair with appropriate states

-   Avoid using shape alone as a status indicator

* * * * *

### üéû Motion / Easing / Duration

**Importance**: Adds continuity, helps users understand changes in state\
**What to cover**:

-   Easing curves (`ease-in-out`, `ease-snappy`)

-   Tokenized durations (fast, normal, slow)

-   Motion ramps for interaction and navigation patterns

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable non-essential animation

-   Avoid flashing, rapid or looping effects

-   Use animation to reinforce, not distract

* * * * *

### üß± Grid Systems & Columns

**Importance**: Framework for structure, alignment, and responsive flow\
**What to cover**:

* * * * *

### ‚ú≥Ô∏è State & Interaction Tokens

**Importance**: Standardizes component behavior across states\
**What to cover**:

-   Motion or shadow changes per state

-   Example: `color.background.hover`, `state.disabled.opacity`

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Ensure clear visual focus indicators (outline, glow, or border)

-   Maintain keyboard navigation for all interactive states

-   Support screen reader feedback for state changes

* * * * *

### üöß Border & Stroke

**Importance**: Frames and defines component boundaries\
**What to cover**:

-   Tokenized border widths and colors

-   Divider usage and conventions

-   Alignment and pixel-snapping

**‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility Considerations**:

-   Borders must be visible against adjacent surfaces

-   Use clear borders around inputs and interactive areas

-   Don't use borders alone to indicate status --- pair with icons or text

* * * * *

* * * * *

3\. ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessibility (Core Foundation)
-------------------------------------- 

**Importance**: Accessibility is a core design system foundation --- not just a checklist item.\
For large systems, accessible design ensures inclusive, compliant, and scalable experiences. It aligns usability with equity and enhances performance across devices, platforms, and user abilities.

### ‚úÖ What to Cover:

-   **Standards & Principles**:

    -   WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 and APCA

    -   POUR model: Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust

-   **Assistive Technology Support**:

    -   Semantic HTML

    -   ARIA roles and attributes

    -   Landmarks and focus management

-   **Accessibility-First Design Tokens**:

    -   Color contrast tokens (`color.text.on-primary`)

    -   Focus rings (`focus.outline`, `state.focus.shadow`)

    -   Opacity for disabled states

    -   Spacing for touch targets and legibility

### üõ† Tooling:

-   **Design**:

    -   Stark, Able, Contrast plugins in Figma

-   **Code**:

    -   `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y`, axe-core, Lighthouse

-   **Token-Level Support**:

    -   Reduced motion support: `prefers-reduced-motion`

    -   Accessible ramps for spacing, typography, and motion

    -   Design token validation for contrast

### üß† Mindset:

Frame accessibility as a design constraint that sharpens decision-making and unlocks broader reach. A system that is **accessible by default** is easier to maintain, test, and scale.
