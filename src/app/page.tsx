                <p>
                  I've created a figma plugin for design system teams that
                  allows design and development to be closer in sync, allowing
                  for a fairly optimized and automated process for syncing our
                  design assets to our code assets through GitHub. Designers
                  have control over which of their designed assets gets output
                  from the tooling, developers have control over what gets
                  checked into the codebase, site, and packages. Utilizing
                  bidirectional sync with GitHub based on versioning, design and
                  development now have a dual turn key moment for releasing new
                  changes in things like iconography, design tokens, and
                  illustrations. Designers have the ability to see the status of
                  their work, and developers have visibility into what changes
                  are made instead of reaching blindly into the google folder to
                  grab all icons and hope that nothing breaks again
                </p>
                <p>
                  By bridging the gap between design and code here, I have saved
                  hours and hours of manual process for our team.

              <p>
                For our Nike foundations design system library, I created a
                figma plugin that takes the design tokens that are defined in
                one figma library and hoists them into other design system
                libraries managed by the different arms of our organizations.
                These libraries consume the base tokens in both design and code,
                while making sure their output from the organization level
                (enterprise, consumer, and marketing) allow their teams to best
                optimize their design system tokens and component libraries for
                their needs.
              </p>
              <p>
                This work allows for smartly checking for changes, deprecations,
                and updating referenced tokens in the library, a feature that
                figma severely lacked during this phase of their product.
              </p>
              <p>
                This tool augments the work we did for the foundations library,
                and helps keep design and development a lot closer together in
                code.

                In late 2021, the Consumer, Marketing, and Enterprise leaders
                got together to figure out how to work towards an even tighter
                collaboration on design across our orgs. The result led to me
                and my lead developer on the enterprise design system to co-lead
                the effort with leads from each org to design a foundational
                library that feeds all three org-focused design systems. To pull
                redundancy of designing the design tokens, base components, and
                overall codebases, I helped architect and build several internal
                tools that take the existing properties of Figma libraries,
                branching, GitHub, and the Figma plugin system and created
                custom tooling that outputs and links our foundational figma
                library to GitHub for our developers, and links the foundational
                library to other figma libraries. This connection allows us to
                change underlying tokens in a turn key moment between design and
                development to ensure the updates to code and design can happen
                simultaneously with the correct values and little lag time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through this, I helped facilitate intense design system
                workshops, build incredible tooling, and solve a long standing
                problem in large corporate design systems

                I worked for 18 months designing and building the enterprise
                branch of the Nike design system. Prior to me joining, Nike had
                several micro design systems focused on internal tools built by
                various teams because the current system did not support their
                use case. During the transition to a new internal design
                organization called Technical Product Experience Design(TPxD),
                myself and several other designers brought several changes to
                the way Nike designs for internal experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here I focused on creating a unified style that honors the
                consumer design library, yet crafts components and layouts for
                dense data, analytics, and form inputs. The system was served to
                several hundred teams and has garnered a high adoption rate
                across the org.

                I was one of the first designers contracted with their team. It
                was a pre launch product gaining traction with early investors
                and together with the engineering, design, and product leads,
                put together a product outline for what they were pitching to
                our investors.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this work, I had a lot of roles. I co designed the early
                product interface, while owning more of the systems level
                thinking. I led branding and identity workshops with our team,
                which then expanded into design systems, figma organization
                management, documentation, user experience process templates and
                docs, and building our library of assets to help accelerate our
                product design.

                I worked on the Salesforce Sustainabilitu Cloud which functions
                as a carbon emissions tracker, analytics, and data reporting
                tool for companies focused on improving the emissions of their
                buildings and supply chain. This tool was enterprise focused and
                heavily relied on the ability to intelligently connect high
                quantities of data with related, relevant, and statistically
                interesting datapoints across a companies current organizational
                landscape.
              </p>
              <p>
                The tooling required improvements in their overarching user
                experience, onboarding and setup flows, and data uploading and
                display interfaces. Together with my development team, we
                explored custom components designed and developed within our
                design system guidelines, integrations with Artificial
                intelligence, analytics, and the reporting features of the

                innovating experiences with our browser that set us apart from
                any chromium based browser. Microsoft had asked me to come in
                from my work with applying branding to digital products to help
                with features within edge on both the consumer and development
                personas.

                I had several features I worked on with groupings of other
                designers on the team. Collections, a quick save tool that
                augments searching and saving web content for better
                organization, categorization, decision making, and storing.

                After we were getting close to launch, I shifted focus to the
                development side of the platform to help improve the usability,
                accessibility, and features for our devtools developer tool. I
                focused on uniquely propositioned features such as intelligent
                font debugging, layers and z-index inspection from a 3d
                perspective, and creating a micro design system in figma for the
                developer tools.

                This work helped grow out features that differentiate our
                product so when it launched it could garner interest and gain
                momentum for use as Microsoft transitioned to windows 12
