    <h1 class="name"><span>Hey there! I'm Darian Rosebrook, a product designer that helps businesses design better end to end user experiences. </span></h1>
    <p>You know when youâ€™re using an app or website and you get frustrated when it doesn't do what you want it to? I work to help make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
    <p>I work as a digital product designer in the Seattle area. Here, I utilize my consulting background in user experience design and brand identity design to create better end to end experiences people have with products they love.</p>
    <p>I have also worked with large companies, VC backed startups, bootstrapped startups, multiple clients in brandind and experience design. I've worked cross collaboratively, setting up design processes for the Developer Experiences team with Microsoft's Edge. I've built a design system and design process for Common Room's product team. I've designed an entire community app and website with a small team for the community that I run. I mentor and teach other designers ways to become better freelancers, designers, and communicators.</p>
    <h4>I am currently looking for my next role as a product designer</h4>
