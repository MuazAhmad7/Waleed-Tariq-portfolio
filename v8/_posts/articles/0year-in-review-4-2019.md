This year is a unique moment to be writing a year in review post.

We just ended the decade of the 2010s.

We’re just now starting the decade of the 2020s

I graduated from high school in 2010, which seems like ages ago, yet not that far away. From there, I left for college, started a design business, had two kids, got engaged twice, then married, left my job as a banker, got a job as a designer, and had as many ups and downs as someone should as a human being in a decade.

## 2019 was one of the craziest years I had so far.
Let’s look back at where I started and where I’ve been.
1. [My first full year as a designer was hard for me (2016-2017)](https://compassofdesign.com/articles/year-zero-my-journey-as-a-designer), I had started learning design and deciding to leave my job as a bank teller and heavily research becoming a designer full-time.
2. [My second year was fun (2017-2018)](https://compassofdesign.com/articles/i-just-completed-two-years-of-moonlighting-as-a-freelance-designer). I had opened the newsletter to the world and started building both the Compass of Design brand as well as my branding design practice, So Magnetic.
3. [My 3rd year, I kind of fell flat on my face. (2018-2019)](https://compassofdesign.com/articles/falling-flat-on-my-face) I had planned on building the community site and the business to full swing, and I couldn’t focus on the right priority and lost myself a lot of money in the process.
4. This fourth year of becoming a designer, I took on two massive goals and kind of hit both of them. Let’s look.

*Hey, do you not have time for the full thing?* Well, I respect that and here’s the high level of what I’ll be talking about (I do want you to know that these posts are usually full of resources that helped me get past tough points in the year.):

*These can turn into long articles, so for a TLDR of what I learned this last year:*

### I had two goals for 2019
#### 1. Switch from working as a banker full time to working as a designer full time
I successfully did this, but not in a way that I would have expected. I was looking to do this by going full time into my freelance business.

After a few months of no clients, I decided to look at finding a job but struggled to get past the interview stages with my non-traditional design background. Once I finally gave up on that and decided to pursue clients again, I got a call from someone staffing a job at Microsoft.

I had a phone interview on Friday, an in-person interview on Monday, and took the position before I left the campus.

#### 2. Successfully charge $10,000 for a logo design.
I had billed almost $10,000 over three design jobs in 2 months. However, I didn’t get all the money from it. One of the companies that were supposed to pay my business for design services had a complication with a client and went bankrupt. But, now that I could see that I could command the consulting fees that I wanted for doing excellent design work, I had my eyes set for what I would like for my work as a designer.

Because of the results of the first goal, I ended up going a different route than client work. I started earning the same monthly income that I had wanted to make with my own business, just for a single company instead of multiple clients.

## The biggest lessons that I learned
1. Companies can learn to value design, especially the value that comes from the work you do when designing an experience. It’s good to find companies that understand this already, however.
2. The same creative skills you use for critical thinking as a designer can be applied towards designing a design organization
3. Branding and user experience both lend each other the same goals and values
4. That taking the year off from Compass and content production was what I needed to get back on the horse

- To help companies realize the value that you create, not only by having good design as the face of their company but also through the clarity they get when designing the experiences they want for their customers.
- That big business eats up good consultants
