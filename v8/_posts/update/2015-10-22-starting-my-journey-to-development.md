Hello World!

As of today, I am starting fresh. I have decided to pursue creating things on the web. I've done things with web tech years back, but never at a full level. In the end it makes sense to me that this would be what I choose. I used to play around a lot editing websites to do what I wanted them to do. Never did I think that people got paid to do this full time, nor the full impact a career like this could have. So I've decided to pursue this with everything I've got. I've got a path, and a will to learn. Let's do this!
