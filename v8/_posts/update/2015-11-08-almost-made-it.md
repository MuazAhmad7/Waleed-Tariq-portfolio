So I almost made it through the interview process for a marketing role. The job required a slight knowledge of CSS and HTML to be able to update product pages. It would have been really cool to actually get my hands dirty.

I took a refresher course on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I remembered more than I thought. Getting the job would have helped a bit to get real world experience, but I'll keep trying out there.
