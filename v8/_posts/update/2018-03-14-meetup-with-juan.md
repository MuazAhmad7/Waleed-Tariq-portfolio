One of the things that I run is a design community for people who are looking to increase their skills as a designer. This week, I was able to meet up with [Juan Valera](https://twitter.com/justcallmejuan) from the design agency [Coastal](https://coastalco.co). He runs this agency full time and is in the product design space for the medical industry. Definitely go [check out the work he did on this case study for Twistle](https://cmps.co/redesigning-twistle). Juan is a member of the [Compass of Design Commmunity](https://compassofdesign.com/community) so it was good to finally meet up after talking over the last 2 years online.
