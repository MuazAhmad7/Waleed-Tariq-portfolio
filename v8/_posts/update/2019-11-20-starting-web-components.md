While working on this new update to my portfolio a few months back, I noticed that I had been using Jekyll in a way that makes it feel more like making components. I came across an issue where I wanted to get further into having more templated sections of my site, and though I know that web components and react is a thing, it seemed daunting to a designer who develops. I came across [this helpful resource by Dave Rupert about jekyll includes](https://daverupert.com/2017/07/jekyll-includes-are-cool/) which solved my issue, but I figured, if I'm trying to make Jekyll do all of this here, I might as well be using web components. So I'll be focusing my next iteration of my website as making it an entire progressive web app.
