After 9 months on the Edge Design team at Microsoft, we shipped our new browser based on Chromium. I had helped with the Collections feature, and recently been working on the DevTools project to set up and help scale the design effort going on there. It was a great experience being able to be the representative of design in a new collaboration. I helped introduce design earlier in the process of feature development, and got to lead the design for the project up to launch. My work for the project ended right as they were starting the next phase of the product cycle. I loved every minute working with the talented people there and hope that I'll get to continue elsewhere on similar projects in the future.
