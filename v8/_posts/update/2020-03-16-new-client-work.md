title: Product design consulting for community based apps
specific: product-consultant
---
I've been working with other product designers a lot recently to help them review their portfolio of work and give them consulting on how to use tools, build design systems, and find new work. It's been really rewarding, but as a result of this, my name got around and I was able to join up with a stealth startup who has been looking for someone to do exactly that. I am getting to set up a design system from scratch, lay foundations for a design org to scale, and work on pre-product consulting while we get things ready for stakeholders. This has been really challenging, but really rewarding.
