# Overview

I led the Visual Interface Design and User Experience Roadmaps for any designs that the company worked on for projects and handled the delivery of design assets to the developers. We worked primarily on web apps for clients, where I led the design department. KeySpark works as a remote team and where we would work and collaborate over tools like Slack, Trello, JIRA, InVision, and TeamSpeak

## Branding

### First rebrand

We had moved away from the initial branding because it didn't fit the way the founder wanted their brand to be represented. So we came up with a style guide for what inspired Tyrel, and I went ahead and created the branding they used for nearly the whole first year I was with them.

### Second rebrand

They wanted to be able to reduce their logo to black and white as well as decided to change the casing of their logo design. They really loved the original branding that I had done and wanted to keep as much of it in the new version of their logo.

### Third rebrand

They were moving away from doing client work and more towards doing software as a service. As a result they wanted to change their logo one more time and create a version that was different than the original. This also required planning to do team gear and see how to expand branding beyond just their website.

## Website

Though you see the final design above in the branding section, I had left the team before that version was created.

However, I did do a flow chart for user experience purposes and work with the founder to set the vision of what the site structure should be. We then built that out in a style similar to what you see below.

## Client work

KeySpark took on their own clients, where I got to lead the design initiatives for the projects, doing user flow charts, user experience design work, redesigning their client's sites, and leading the team to implement the changes.
