## Microsoft Edge
On January 15, 2020, Microsoft launched the new Edge browser built on Chromium. Prior to this launch, I had been working for nearly 9 months with multiple teams in this project helping with product design, user experience, storyboarding, prototyping, and setting up collaboration processes for the design org to scale within Edge and the DevTools project.

Projects included:
- Helping design the component system in Figma for Edge and Edge DevTools
- Worked on the projects and structure of the design process for DevTools.
- User Experience Design and Product Design work on the flow and function of new and existing Edge DevTools features (What's new, Font Tooling, settings, personalization, sources, network, and much more)
- Reviewing and approving design changes going into our product's codebase
- Collaboration and consulting with cross-functional teams of Product Managers and Engineers to create feature spec documents and bring design to the table conversation
- Helping Product teams discover opportunities within potential use-cases of the product
- Partnering with team leads to map and refine our internal product design processes
- Delivering multi-functioning prototypes, custom iconography and digital brand assets within features like Collections, Privacy, DevTools, and the external social media accounts for Edge and Edge's extensions
- Working with Engineering, Designers, and our developer experiences team to reimagine our internal design tools
- UX and UI work on Edge's first-run experience within tools like Collections, 3D View, Personalization, etc.
- Presenting and delivering creative work to the team stakeholders



## Collections in Microsoft Edge

Collections is a feature that allows people to save important information and media from around the web. It enables people to take notes, save pages and images, as well as tons of future plans for some really cool things.
### My role
![Collections for Microsoft Edge design by Darian Rosebrook](/assets/img/work/ms/1.png)
I got to help support the team in releasing the first iteration of the tool. I worked on a handful of identity items and the user experience behind a handful of features that are both used an unused in the feature as it stands today.

We worked on this tool in tandem together. While the final feature carries some of the work that I have done, not everything below made it into the first iteration of the project.

Everything below is a small portion of work that I created to supply the team with full mockups, interaction design, illustrative branding, and experience / technological consideration.

## Redesigning the Edge Design team's product design process
This was a deep dive into the product design process that the design team at Edge uses. While the work here isn't visible publicly, it helped map and improve the process that the team and I used over the integration of the DevTools Engineers and the User experience teams.

## Unopinionated framework for the web
To show the true versatility of the components we were creating, I recreated the modules that we used within product pages to show how they can be used for nearly any page or product within the Microsoft family.

###### These are built using the component system we created entirely in figma

###### Using these same components to build a product page based on familiar pages to the projects we are working with.

## Devtools
### My role
I got to help lead the design initiative for the Edge DevTools design engagements. I wasn't the first designer to the project, nor will I be the last, but my role on this project was to help establish the design process and collaboration method for design asks on the PM and Engineering side. On top of this, I moved a lot of our component work to showcase the direction as it existed in the project to further meet accessibility goals, as well as introducing new feature work with the PM team.

On top of this work for Microsoft, we often would collaborate with Google, meaning my work would encompass both companies' visions on certain projects.

Though I was the only designer in the project, after setting up the design process and file structure for the project, my work here would be passed on to a team of 6 so the project could scale.
