            <p>While working as a full time Product Designer for Microsoft, I wanted to use some of my free time to continue building the story of Overtone, a post-earth era digital comic that follows the life of ex-cop [name]. I'm currently working on creating the home of the novel as well, trying to find a cadence of release that would be feasible. </p>

            <p>My thought is to release this chapter by chapter until the first volume is complete. </p>

          <p >This project has been a huge step in what I'm able to achieve as the sole person on a project. This product utilizes my knowledge in UX Design, UI Design, and Back End Development by wrapping all of those together into one product. The Compass of Design Membership Site. This platform is going to be a powerhouse in helping designers get actionable feedback on questions they have and designs they've done. So far, there hasn't been a site that effectively does this without it becoming a popularity contest. Our goal here is to change the way we do design feedback!</p>
